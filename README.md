Welcome! 

This portfolio comprises samples of my web and app development work, and includes the following: 

-Full builds of apps completed as part of my coursework 
-Sample files of a game app that is currently under development
-JS & CSS Code for online course interactives for use in Drupal and Moodle
-A Bioinformatics tool I created in OCaml

Some of this code is still under development, so please do not implement without requesting permission.

Enjoy!
