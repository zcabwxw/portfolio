CS61 Problem Sets -- Introduction
Nevin Katz

These are samples of work for my CS61 class (Systems Programming and Machine 
Organization). While these involve primarily lower-level systems concepts, I believe that some of the concepts are transferable to front-end engineering. 

problem sets 1, 2, and 5 can be run using "make check." That will compile the code and run a series of tests. Code files containing problem set code that I wrote can be found below. 

pset 1: m61.c
pset 2: io61.c
pset 4: kernel.c
pset 5: sh61.c
pset 6: pong61.c

pset 3 is not included because it did not entail coding, but rather involved using GDB to diffuse  a "binary bomb." 

In all cases, there was some skeleton code present at the beginning of each p-set that I built upon.  

Comments on each of the p-sets can be found in the README.txt files that were included with the p-set submission. Further introductory comments can be found in the README_CA.txt file within each p-set directory.
