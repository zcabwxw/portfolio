Problem Set 2 - File I/O

The purpose of this assignment was to write a file IO program whose speed is competitive with the stdio.h program under a range of conditions. Strategies used include a cache, system call minimization, and memory mapping. 

The code I wrote can be found in io61.c, and can be tested by running "make check."
