IDEA for a seekable write cache: 

We seek to the spot on the write file

We write the data into the cache with a specific position.

Perhaps the data block is a struct with a position attached to it. 

Data blocks are placed into  

PROBLEM! If cache is incomplete, data blocks could be sorted in the wrong order. 

Get numblocks. 

Blocks are sorted into tiers. 

if first tier is full, write 1!
if second tier is full and first tier is done, write 2!
if first & second are done and third is done, write!
