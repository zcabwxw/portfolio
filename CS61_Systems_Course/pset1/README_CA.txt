Problem Set 1: Memory Management

The purpose of this assignment was to write a debugging memory allocator that tracks and debugs memory usage, and catches errors on the tests.   

The code I wrote for this p-set can be found in m61.c, and can be tested by running "make check"while in this directory. All files in the directory must be downloaded and must be present on an x86 machine for this code to work.
