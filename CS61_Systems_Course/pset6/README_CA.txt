Problem Set 6 - Network Pong and Concurrency

I wrote this code with a partner as part of a problem set for CS61 (Systems Programming and Machine Organization) on concurrency and networking. It was designed to run as the client-end of a server-client end wherein the server was showing "non-ideal" behavior. While the server is no longer up, the code provides some examples of strategies employed to avoid race conditions, such as mutex locks. Further information on strategies we employed to avoid race conditions can be found in the README.txt file.
