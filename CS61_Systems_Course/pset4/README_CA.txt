Problem Set 4: Kernel Programming

This code was meant to be run in a specific virtual machine environment,  and therefore will not run on a normal x86 machine. That said, it provides some examples of kernel programming, including working with page tables and an implementation of fork. The code I wrote can primarily be found in kernel.c.
