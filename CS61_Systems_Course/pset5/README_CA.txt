Problem Set 5

The purpose of this program was to write one's own shell. This assignment demonstrates implementations of sequential commands, background commands, pipes, and other basic shell functionality. There is also "history" functionality which can be seen by typing "history" while running the shell. 

Code for this p-set can be found in sh61.c, and can be tested by running "make check." You can also run "make" and then run "./sh61" to run the shell.
