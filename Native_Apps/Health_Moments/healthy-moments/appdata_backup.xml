            <content id="0">Healthy behaviors are one way to help children stay healthy so they can focus on learning. A familyâ€™s approach to healthy behaviors is influenced by their health beliefs and culture and by their access to health information in a language they can understand. </content>
            <content id="1">As a home visitor, you have a unique opportunity to provide health information that you and your families can discuss together. You know the needs and goals of the families you visit and can share easy-to-understand information to help them learn more about healthy behaviors. If there are barriers that prevent parents and families from adding new practices to their daily routines, you can help families think about how to include them in ways that are individualized to meet their needs. Even a few changes in daily routines can help the whole family by reducing illnesses that prevent adults from going to school or work. But, the first step is finding a good time to bring up these topics and knowing what to say.</content>
