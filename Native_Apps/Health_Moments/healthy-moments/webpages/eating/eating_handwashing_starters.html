<h1>Conversation starters</h1>


<p>If a parent is feeding her child or you are discussing nutrition issues, say,</p>

<p>&quot;I know you want to make sure your child is healthy. Handwashing is something you can do—and teach your child to do—that really works. Would it be okay to talk about this now?&quot;</p>
 
<p>Or say,</p>

<p>&quot;We talked about why it is important for you and your child to wash your hands and make handwashing part of your daily routine. I wondered how this is working for you.&quot;</p>
                
<p>And, if you have not discussed handwashing before but observe the adult practicing this behavior, say,</p>

<p>&quot;I see that you are washing your hands. You are doing something really important to keep your child healthy! Did you know . . .&quot;</p>

</p>Then provide appropriate information about handwashing.</p>
 
<p>Or, if you have already discussed this topic, say,</p>

<p>&quot;I see that you are washing your hands—you really heard what we talked about!&quot;</p>
