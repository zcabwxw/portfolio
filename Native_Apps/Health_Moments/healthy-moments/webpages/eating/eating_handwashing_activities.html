<h1>Learning activities</h1>

<p><strong>Play food.</strong> Bring some play food on the home visit and have a pretend meal with a toddler or preschool child and his parent. Then talk about how handwashing before eating helps to keep our bodies healthy.</p>

<p><strong>Handwashing can be fun.</strong> Most children love to play in water. They usually enjoy making bubbles as they mix water and soap, which can make washing hands a fun experience. While washing hands, parents can sing to young children or  count their fingers. Older children can sing or rhyme, count, and practice their independent skills.</p>

<p><strong>Germ Handprints.</strong> Use household flour or cornstarch as “germs.” Sprinkle some flour on a table and have the child or parent touch the “germs”; then watch how the germs spread.  </p>

<li>Try this in the kitchen. Sprinkle on the counter, touch it, and then touch the faucet, cabinet handles, etc.</li>

<li>Share that washing the germs off your hands prevents the germs from spreading to surfaces in your home.</li>
