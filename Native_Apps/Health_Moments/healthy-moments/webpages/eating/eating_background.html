<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Germs can spread from our hands to our mouth, to a child’s mouth, bottle nipple, or eating utensils.  </p>
<p>Adults should:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Wash hands before eating or feeding to reduce germs on their hands.</li>

			<li>Wash the high-chair, tray or table that food will touch.</li>

			<li>Avoid sharing eating utensils or other items that have been in someone else’s mouth.</li>
