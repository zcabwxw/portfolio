<h1>Integrating Healthy Behaviors into a Home Visit</h1>
<p>Healthy behaviors are one way to help children stay healthy. Families’ approaches to healthy behaviors are influenced by beliefs, culture and access to health information.</p>
<p>As a home visitor, you have a unique opportunity to provide health information in ways that work for families.
