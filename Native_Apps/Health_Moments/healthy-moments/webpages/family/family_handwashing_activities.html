<p><strong>Handwashing can be fun.</strong> Most children love to play in water. They usually enjoy making bubbles as they mix water and soap, which can make washing hands a fun experience. While washing hands, parents can sing to young children or  count their fingers. Older children can sing or rhyme, count, and practice their independent skills by washing their hands.</p>

<p><strong>Germ Handprints.</strong> Use household flour or cornstarch as “germs.” Sprinkle some flour on a table and have the child or parent touch the “germs." Then, watch how the germs spread.  </p>
