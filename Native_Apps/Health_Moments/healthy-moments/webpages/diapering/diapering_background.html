<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Germs can spread easily from fecal material (stool) in a bathroom onto hands, flushers, and faucets, and make you sick.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Donâ€™t change diapers on any surface that is used for food.</li>
    <li>After diapering, washing hands and the changing table/toilet area helps to keep germs from spreading.</li>
    <li>Help children to wash their hands each time they use the toilet.</li>
