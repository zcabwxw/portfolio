<h1>Conversation starters</h1>

<p>When a child begins toileting independently, say,</p>

<p>&quot;I know your child really likes to do things by himself, and you have done a wonderful job of helping him to be independent. Now that he is using the toilet by himself, I wonder if it would be helpful to talk to him about how to remember to wash his hands every time he uses the toilet?&quot;</p>

<p>If the parent diapers the baby while you are present, say,</p>

<p>&quot;I noticed you washed your hands when you were done. That helps make sure any germs from your baby’s diaper do not spread into other places in your home like the kitchen or your child’s toys.&quot;</p>
