<h1>Overview</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Germs transfer easily from cooking surfaces to our hands, or from our hands to the food we are cooking.</li>

	<li>Some foods, such as raw meats and some fruits and vegetables that we buy in the grocery store, contain germs that can make people sick, especially infants, children, and pregnant women.</li>

	<li>Adults should:

		<ul><li>Clean surfaces where food preparation occurs.</li>

			<li>Prepare meats and other foods separately to avoid mixing bacteria from raw meat with foods that will not be cooked.</li>

			<li>Wash surfaces after handling raw meat.</li>

			<li>Wash all counters, dishes, and utensils that come into contact with raw meat.</li>
			<li>Wash fruits and vegetables.</li>

			<li>Avoid the habit of tasting food more than once with the same utensil; this act transfers germs from our mouths back to the food, and someone else can pick them up.</li>
</ul></li>
