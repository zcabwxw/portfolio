<h1>Conversation starters</h1>

<p>As you are beginning to start a cooking activity, say,</p>

<p>&quot;I have some information that I like to share with families about washing fruits and vegetables. Would you be interested?&quot;</p>
 
<p>Or say,</p>

<p>&quot;I’ve found that many people don’t know that raw meat can leave germs on the counter while it’s being prepared. I’d like to tell you about some simple steps to follow when cooking or handling raw meat. Is now a good time to talk about this?&quot;</p>
