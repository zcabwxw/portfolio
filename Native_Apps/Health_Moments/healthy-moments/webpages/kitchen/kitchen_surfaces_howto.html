        <h1>How to wash surfaces</h1>
        <ul>
            
            <li><strong>How to wash surfaces depends on what type of cleaning you will do.</strong> The labels on cleaning products provide instructions on how to use the product appropriately for different uses.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Cleaning</strong> removes visible soil, dirt, and most germs. Soap and water will clean most surfaces.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Sanitizing</strong> reduces germs to a level that is unlikely to cause disease, but does not totally get rid of them. You may want to sanitize surfaces where you eat (such as a table or high chair tray) and toys that children place in their mouths. It is important to follow the instructions on the label. This may also include rinsing surfaces/toys after using the sanitizing product to remove any remaining chemicals.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Disinfecting</strong> destroys or inactivates infectious germs on surfaces. Disinfectants may be used on diaper-changing tables, toilets, and counter tops. Be sure to follow the instructions on the product label.<sup>10</sup></li>
