Biostat51

This is a Bioinformatics Command Line tool that I wrote in Ocaml for CS51: Abstraction and Design, a CS course at the Harvard Extension School. The tool is designed to assess the similarities between two DNA sequences using three different algorithms. It is also able to translate an RNA sequence into an amino acid sequene.

 My partner assisted with writing the parser and the output tool, while I wrote the algorithms and created the various modules. The final grade was 49/50. Additional background can be found in the accompanying PDF.
